## Goal

  The purpose of this project was to create an app that would display a user’s genetic information from 23andme in a way that would be more helpful than raw data. Specifically, we chose to focus on understanding genetic variations associated with the steroid hormones so users could make more informed decisions about birth control. Over the past semester, we compiled relevant genetic information, created an API that worked with 23andme, and found a way to present this information in a way that a lay-person would understand.
  
## Problems We Faced
- Creating algorithm to determine users predisposition to certain drugs
- Creating a dynamic flowchart to display information visually
- Lack of scientific data (i.e we are ahead of the science)

## Tools Used
- FLASK
- SQL
- OAuth
- HTML and CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- 23andme API

## thesexyproject So Far
- Created database to hold genetic information created ( [see wiki for more info](https://github.com/CS196Illinois/thesexyproject/wiki) )
- Created website front-end (WIP - see wiki for more info)
- Creatd data visualizations

## Future Goals
- Expand database
- Create expansive algorithm to help with determining a user’s reactivity to certain birth controls/drugs
- Expand front end website
